### Update 2024

This project is no longer maintained.

It was discontinued due to costs of maintaining the website/server on googles cloud platform.

Maybe at some point in the future it will undergo a major refactor/redesign and be resurrected... ;)

## About 
This project's purpose is to promote the unique beauty of Kraków's architecture by highlighting all the different animal-themed emblems found on various historic buildings in Kraków (there is over 100 of them!).

The website is a single-page web application that shows an interactive map of Kraków with all the animal-themed emblems marked on the map. It has a simple authentication system that allows users to create an account, login, and upload a photo to of a unique architectural detail and add it to the interactive map. The photo and it's details will then be stored in GCP (sql + google-cloud-storage). This photo will then be visible for all to see on the map.
